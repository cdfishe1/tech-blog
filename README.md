## Deployment

Site deployed at [Tech Blog](https://gentle-anchorage-28977.herokuapp.com/)

## Scope of Project

* Uses express.js, mysql2, and sequelize to create a webserver that runs locally or via Heroku.

## Challenges

* I really struggled on this project. This app throws a lot of errors that I have not been able to resolve.
* A user is able to create an account, login, create an article, view articles, update articles, and delete articles.
* I have not been able to figure out how to make comments on particular articles appear with those articles.
* I have not been able to figure out how to leverage session id's for controlling access, despite having the withAuth helper function.

## Installation

* npm install to download all the dependencies in node.
* Deploy files to webserver such as Heroku for live app usage.

## Credits

* David Metcalf, bootcamp tutor, helped me understand how to think about the the nature of routing with handlebars and calling to the api routes.
